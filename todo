Structures:

- V_STRING, V_MUTABLE_STRING

MML:

- Efficient implementation

Overall:

- New loop syntax?
- Void safety?

Disadvantages of agents vs. infinite models

- Had to introduce "filtered" instead of "intersection" with infinite set
(but user interface is better)
- Cannot express an image of a finite set under infinite map
(because of generic params)
- Cannot have "compliment" for sets and relations 

Known bugs:

- Search doesn't work properly if model objects put inside data structures (wrong meaning of the postcondition)
