Structures:

- Do not rely on agents in standard sorted and hash structures
- Finite streams: filter, mapper, folder
- Extender iterator
- V_STRING, V_MUTABLE_STRING

MML:

- Add contracts to model classes
- Add disjoint union to sets
- Carlo's convention for sequence indexing?
- Efficient implementation

Overall:

- New loop syntax
- Void safety?

Disadvantages of agents vs. infinite models

- Had to introduce "filtered" instead of "intersection" with infinite set
(but user interface is better)
- Cannot express an image of a finite set under infinite map
(because of generic params)
- Cannot have "compliment" for sets and relations 

Known bugs:

- Search doesn't work properly if model objects put inside data structures (wrong meaning of the postcondition)
