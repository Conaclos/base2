Structures:

- Use agents instead of functor classes
- Provide nice output for containers
- RANDOM and STANDARD_INPUT streams
- Should MAP inherit from CONTAINER? Should there be non-updatable MAP?

MML:

- Replace infinite models with agents
- Fix INTEGER_SET
- Efficient implementation

Overall:

- New loop syntax?
- Void safety?

Known bugs:

- Search doesn't work properly if model objects put inside data structures (wrong meaning of the postcondition)
