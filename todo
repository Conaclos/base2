- Remove count_cell from V_BINARY_TREE like from V_LINKED_LIST (try)
- Change implementation of model classes making use of V_ARRAY
- V_LINKED_LIST_ITERATOR.merge should take an iterator?

Known bugs:

- Search doesn't work properly if model objects put inside data structures (wrong meaning of the postcondition)
